First clone the template repository:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git@github.com:jhsu/learning-and-sharing.git
$ cd learning-and-sharing
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have the project checked out, start a new branch for the project
you are working on.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git checkout -b learning-to-be-awesome
{% endhighlight %}

Oh, and don't forget to install dependencies.

{% highlight bash %}
$ bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

Now you are all set to start taking some notes!
