Learning-and-sharing is a template repository to help keep documentation as
you are learning something and then share your notes when you are done.

This project is heavily inspired by a blog post by [Steve Klabnik](http://twitter.com/steveklabnik)
called ["Most things I do are interconnected"](http://words.steveklabnik.com/most-things-i-do-are-interconnected).

You can find the template for this project at
